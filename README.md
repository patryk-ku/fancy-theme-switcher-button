# fancy theme switcher button

[LIVE DEMO](https://jsfiddle.net/patryk_ku/s2hmzp50/1/)

This repository contains only the required html elements and a .css file with styles. There is no script to switch themes or a script to toggle the state of the button itself.

## Usage

Simply using JS add an `.active` class to a div with a `.fancy-theme-switcher-button` class to switch the state of a button to a nighttime appearance.
