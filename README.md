This repository contains only the required html elements and a .css file with styles. There is no script to switch themes or a script to toggle the state of the button itself.

## Usage

Simply using JS add an `.active` class to a div with a `.fancy-theme-switcher-button` class to switch the state of a button to a nighttime appearance.

To resize the button, use the `font-size` of the parent DOM element, as all button dimensions are expressed in `.em` units.
